An example for an origin that cannot be validated by the TypeScript compiler is the result of an SQL query. While you can specify an interface for the result data, the SQL query might still return totally different data at runtime. This can lead to issues that are difficult to debug, so we should fix the root cause by validating that the result of the SQL query machtes the TypeScript interface. We can accomplish this by using JSON schema validation without introducing any real performance penalty (e.g., by using the `ajv` library). The same approach can and should be taken for all other unsafe sources of runtime values such as environment variables or HTTP requests.\\n\\nI call this approach \\"end-to-end type safety\\". If you can rely on the runtime values to match their TypeScript interface - because you validate them when they enter your application boundary - and your application ensures the correct accessing and passing of such values using TypeScript, you pretty much eliminate all runtime errors. Of course there are always edge-cases that slip through, but you should be able to reduce the time you spend inside a debugger by 90+ percent. Note that this approach works best when you leverage as many TypeScript features as possible, such as the `strictNullChecks` option (highly recommended!).
